<!--- Notes on using Git in Terminal ---

git init //initializes a git repository

git status //tells you all that has changed, files deleted/modified/added, if there are gits you need to pull down, etc

git add fileName //stages the file

git add . //add everything in the current directory and all files in subdirectories

git commit -m "message" //commits your added files with a message

git commit //if you forget a commit message, you will launch a program call VIM

git remote add origin githubRepositoryURL //make local repository into a github repository, must create repository in github first

git branch -v //lets you view the branch information on github **learn more about this

git push --set-upstream origin master //track at the origin link in the master branch **wtf is he talking about, requires github username and password

<!--- Working with Github

git clone githubRepositoryURL //clone a github repository onto your local computer

cd repositoryName //change directories into repository containing files you'd like to update in github

touch fileName //create new file

git add fileName //stages file, ready to commit

git commit -m "message goes here" //commits your code

git push origin master //pushes all commits in current repository to github
