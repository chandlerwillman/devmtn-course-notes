/* Toy Problem 1/10/2019 - Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. 
The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. */

    function sumAllNumbers (num){
        var begin = 0;
        for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
            begin += i;
        }
        return begin;
    };

    /* How the teacher did it */

    //Step one - clarify
        // Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

    //Step two - Sample data and solve without coding
        // 1--->55
        // 3--->6

    //Step three - Define data structures
        //function
        //for loop
        //+=

    //Step four - Write pseudo code
        //write a function called summation
        //function takes in a param
        //define a variable and set it to 0
        //write a for loop iterating as many times as the param
        //for each iteration, reassign the variable (initially set to 0) to i
        //return the variable

    //Step five - Solve
    function summation (param){
        let variable = 0;
        for(let i = 0; i <= param; i++){
            variable += i;
        }
        return variable;
    };
